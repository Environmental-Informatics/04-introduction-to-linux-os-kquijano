## Assignment 04 - Introduction to the Linux Operating System

### Lab Objectives

On completion of this lab, students will be able to:
1. Use basic commands in the Linux OS to navigate directories, view and edit files, search for files and file contents, and find help with commands; and
2. Create simple scripts in Bash to encapsulate sequences of simple commands to streamline the completion of more complex tasks.

### Reading Assignment

Work through this tutorial for practical experience in using Liunx and an introduction to the Bash scripting language:

- [Ryans Tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net/): [Linux Tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/)

Other tutorials are available on-line, but I have found this to be reasonable introuction to the components of Linux that I believe are most important and useful for you.  Additionally, the assignment for submission comes directly from this tutorial.
  
To get more in-depth into Linux and the Bash scripting language, I reccommend the book [A Practical Guide to Linux](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-guide-to/9780134774626/).  The following chapters are most relevent to this week's assignment:

- Chapter 1: Welcome to Linux and macOS
- Chapter 2: Getting Started
- Chapter 3: The Utilities
- Chapter 4: The Filesystem
- Chapter 5: The Shell

If you want to drill deeper on either of the two most common text file editors, then also check out:

- Chapter 6: The vim Editor
- Chapter 7: The emacs Editor

### The Lab Assignment

Clone this repository, and work through the tutorial in the repository directory.  You can leave everything related to the tutorial in this main directory.
      
#### What to turn in...

To complete the assignment:

1. Make a directory called "Lab04" in this repository, and copy the following information into that directory:

2. The file resulting from the activities in Part 6 - should be named **"Part_06.txt"**;

3. Provide the original file, and the file after using the sort command in Part 9 - should be called **"Part_09_unsorted.txt"**, and **"Part_09_sorted.txt"**;

4. In Part 11, capture the results of the activity "Now see if you can list only the 20th last file in the directory /etc" by piping them into a file and submitting the results - should be piped into a file called **"Part_11,txt"**; and

5. In Part 13, submit both scripts developed in the **Activities** section at the end of the tutorial page:

  - First script should be called "my_backup.sh"
    - Write your own backup script. You can make it as simple or complex as you like. Maybe start off with a really simple one and progressively improve it.
    
  - Second script should be called "dir_info.sh"
    - Write a script that will give you a report about a given directory.  See tutorial page for suggestions.
    
**Files not in the repository subfolder Lab04, will not be graded.**
